## 1.Write a Java program to test if the first and the last element of an array of integers are same. The length of the array must be greater than or equal to 2 
### Test Data:
array = 50, -20, 0, 30, 40, 60, 10
### Sample Output:
false


## 2.Write a Java program to find the numbers greater than the average of the numbers of a given array. 
### Original Array:
[1, 4, 17, 7, 25, 3, 100]
### Expected Output:
The average of the said array is: 22.0
The numbers in the said array that are greater than the average are:
25
100


## 3.Write a Java program to get the larger value between first and last element of an array of integers.
### Original Array:
[20, 30, 40]   
### Sample Output:
Larger value between first and last element: 40 


## 4.Write a Java program to swap the first and last elements of an array and create a new array. 
### Original Array:
[20, 30, 40]  
### Sample Output:
New array after swapping the first and last elements: [40, 30, 20] 



## 5. Write a program that places the odd elements of an array before the even elements.
### Original Array:
[2,3,40,1,5,9,4,10,7]  
### Sample Output:
[3,1,5,9,7,2,40,4,10]


## 6. Write a program that test the equality of two arrays.
[2,3,6,6,4]
[2,3,6,6,4]
### Sample Output:
true

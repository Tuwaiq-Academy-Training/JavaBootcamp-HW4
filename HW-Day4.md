## 1.Write a Java program to test if the first and the last element of an array of integers are same. The length of the array must be greater than or equal to 2 
### Test Data:
array = 50, -20, 0, 30, 40, 60, 10
### Sample Output:
false


## 2.Write a Java program to find the k largest elements in a given array. Elements in the array can be in any order. 
### Original Array:
[1, 4, 17, 7, 25, 3, 100]
### Expected Output:
3 largest elements of the said array are:
100 25 17


## 3.Write a Java program to find the numbers greater than the average of the numbers of a given array. 
### Original Array:
[1, 4, 17, 7, 25, 3, 100]
### Expected Output:
The average of the said array is: 22.0
The numbers in the said array that are greater than the average are:
25
100



## 4.Write a Java program to test that a given array of integers of length 2 contains a 4 or a 7. 
### Original Array:
[5, 7]
### Sample Output:
true 


## 5.Write a Java program to get the larger value between first and last element of an array (length 3) of integers.
### Original Array:
[20, 30, 40]   
### Sample Output:
Larger value between first and last element: 40 


## 6.Write a Java program to swap the first and last elements of an array (length must be at least 1) and create a new array. 
### Original Array:
[20, 30, 40]  
### Sample Output:
New array after swapping the first and last elements: [40, 30, 20] 


## 7.Write a Java program to find all of the longest word in a given dictionary.
### Example:
{
"cat",
"dog",
"red",
"is",
"am"
}
Result: "cat", "dog", "red"
